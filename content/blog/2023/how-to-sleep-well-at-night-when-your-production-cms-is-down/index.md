The summer break is over, and it's time to get back to regular blogging. We start this season with a conference appearance.

Next week, together with [Marta Cukierman](https://adapt.to/speakers/marta-cukierman), we will be speaking at [AdaptTo() 2023](https://adapt.to/2023/schedule/integrate-grow-repeat-how-websight-real-time-dxp-provides-a-way-to-break-out-of-the-content-centric-model) - "Europe's leading AEM Developer Conference".

The title of our presentation: _Integrate, Grow, Repeat: How Websight Real-Time DXP Provides a Way to Break Out of the Content-Centric Model_ might be a little misleading compared to the title of this post. It is the main reason I have decided to write this short update, and disenchant the mysterious title. 

During the session, we will showcase architectures we used to integrate with other data sources, such as Product Information Management (PIM) with CMS in the center.

We will also talk about an alternative approach to integrate with other systems - the one that actually lets you sleep well at night when your production CMS is down.

And the session will not end with just talking.

Make sure to join us on **Monday, 25th September 2023 at 17:35 CEST**.

Maciej
