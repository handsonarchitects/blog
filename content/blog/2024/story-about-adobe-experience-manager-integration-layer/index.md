Maciej and I established [Knot.x](https://knotx.io/), an open-source initiative developed in 
close collaboration with our then-employer, [Cognifide](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cognifide/). 
This article encapsulates our journey with this project.

## Why
> This passage outlines the issues addressed by Knot.x. 

Knot.x serves as an integration layer enabling the customisation of customer experiences across 
various channels. By amalgamating content and layout from platforms like 
[Adobe Experience Manager](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/adobe-experience-manager) (AEM) 
with data from diverse sources such as search engines, product information management systems, 
and customer services, it facilitates the creation of complex personalised sites. While initially 
tailored for AEM, Knot.x is adaptable to other traditional CMS platforms like Wordpress or Magnolia, 
transforming the CMS-centric architecture into a composable one. This shift yielded significant 
benefits in terms of AEM development efficiency and cost reduction, particularly evident in managing 
global client requirements with minimised AEM expenses (licenses and infrastructure).

Notably, Knot.x drastically decreased page rendering costs by reducing the need for excessive 
AEM licenses, optimising performance, and streamlining integration logic. This optimisation enabled 
handling substantial page requests with minimal server resources. Moreover, Knot.x prioritised speed 
by utilising high-performing JVM-based technology for integration logic, further enhancing efficiency 
and reducing infrastructure requirements.

To simplify integration and composability development, Knot.x introduced "no-code" JSON-based 
integrations with pre-built patterns, empowering engineers to tackle integration challenges without 
delving into complex infrastructure details. This approach fostered innovation within a simplified 
concurrency model akin to technologies like NodeJS.

In essence, Knot.x emerged as a solution to address various challenges in AEM development, maintenance, 
performance, and costs, gaining widespread adoption among multiple Cognifide's clients.
